## Database Migrations (EF Core)
### Overview
For migrations, we need to add them initially and update or re-add them each time the context changes. The actual execution of migrations happen on application start and is autonomous.
### Lessons Learnt
- In order to create migrations, the DB context has to either
    - Have a default constructor.
    - Have a IDesignTimeDbContextFactory implementation. - This allows for providing the args to the overloaded constructor during design-time as there is no DI available during that time. 

### Re-create Migrations (Package-Manager Console)
> dotnet tool install --global dotnet-ef

> dotnet ef migrations add InitialMigration -c DevicesDbContext -o Migrations/ --project FrostAura.Services.Devices.Data

## Docker Support
### Local
The project supports being run as a container and is in fact indended to. In order to run this service locally, simply run `docker-compose up` in the directory where the `docker-compose.yml` file resides. The service will now run on port 8083:HTTPS, 8082:HTTP.
### Docker Hub
Automated builds are set up for Docker Hub. To use this service without the source code running, use 
- `docker pull frostauraconsolidated/devices` or 
- Visit https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/frostauraconsolidated/devices.

After the service is running, simply confirm that the service is running correctly by navigating to https://localhost:8083/.

NOTE: For the container to work (HTTPS) by itself, we will require a valid SSL cert. You can simply create a dev self-signed cert using dotnet CLI, after which we can map it to the container. See below for local / development. For production you should have a valid cert. See https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/docker-compose-https?view=aspnetcore-3.1 for more.

    dotnet dev-certs https --clean
    dotnet dev-certs https -ep %USERPROFILE%\.aspnet\https\aspnetapp.pfx -p Password1234
    dotnet dev-certs https --trust
